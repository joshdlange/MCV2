## 🔧 Payment Flow Architecture

### 1. Frontend Payment Initiation
- User clicks "Upgrade to Super Hero" 
- Frontend calls `/api/create-checkout-session`
- User redirected to Stripe checkout page

### 2. Stripe Checkout Process
- User enters payment details on Stripe-hosted page
- Payment processed securely by Stripe
- User redirected to success/cancel URL

### 3. Webhook Automation (NEW!)
- Stripe sends webhook event to `/api/stripe-webhook`
- Server verifies webhook signature using STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
