Why Your Current Queries Fail
Your current queries look like:

"Impel Marvel Universe Series III Spider-Man 1"

Problems:

Too verbose — sellers rarely write out full set names.

Card number almost never used in title — eBay sellers don’t say “Card 1”.

Too strict — eBay doesn't rank results well when the full title doesn’t match.

🔍 How Marvel Cards Are Actually Listed on eBay
Most successful listings follow patterns like:

"1992 Marvel Spider-Man #1 Impel Series 3"

"Spider-Man Marvel card hologram 1992"

"Marvel Universe Series 3 Spider-Man NM"

"1992 Marvel Impel Carnage PSA 9"

"Venom Marvel Impel NM-MT card"

So, sellers often:

Omit full set name

Use abbreviated set references like “Impel”, “Fleer”, “Skybox”

Include character name + Marvel

Occasionally use year or ‘insert’/‘holo’/’foil’

Include grade info (e.g. PSA 9) if applicable

✅ New Suggested Strategy for Queries
Tell Replit to try a tiered query approach:

First try:

ts
Copy
Edit
"1992 Spider-Man Marvel"
If zero results:

ts
Copy
Edit
"Spider-Man Marvel card"
If still zero, fallback:

ts
Copy
Edit
"Spider-Man Marvel Impel"
(Optional): Try including "card #1" in the keywords but not relying on it

Then filter the results based on:

Character name match (includes('spider-man'))

Year match (includes('1992'))

Optional: Image similarity (future upgrade)

🧩 Extra Tips
Sort by BestMatch or EndTimeSoonest works fine

Include filters like:

ts
Copy
Edit
'itemFilter(0).name': 'SoldItemsOnly',
'itemFilter(0).value': 'true'
Set entriesPerPage: 10–25 — beyond that, it slows response time

Avoid strict matching — just get 3–5 best matches and calculate an average sold price from them

✉️ Final Message Prompt for Replit
We're not matching results in the eBay API because our queries are too specific and don't reflect how sellers list cards.

New strategy:

For each card, build 2–3 keyword variations, like:

"1992 Spider-Man Marvel"

"Spider-Man Marvel card"

"Spider-Man Marvel Impel"

Use the findCompletedItems operation with these keywords (in order)

If one returns results, skip the rest and calculate average sold price from top 5

Use fuzzy filters in code to confirm matches: character name, Marvel, year (if available)

This should give us real sold values for 80–90% of the catalog.

Let me know if you'd like a sample implementation of the logic too.
