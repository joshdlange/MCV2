PROJECT: Marvel Card Vault (LIVE in production)
GOAL: Improve subset naming in user-facing UI without changing the database or breaking migration/admin tools.

CONTEXT
Right now, many subsets are stored in `card_sets.name` as a full string in the format:
  "<Main Set Name> - <Subset Name>"
Example:
  "2025 Topps Marvel Comic Book Heroes 1975 Golden Anniversary - Black & Gold"
But in user-facing UI, this is redundant because the user is already inside the main set page.
We want the user to see ONLY the subset portion (e.g., "Black & Gold"), while admins should still see the full name.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
1) DO NOT modify any `card_sets.name` values in the DB.
2) DO NOT change canonical/legacy logic, migration console behavior, or any route that is used for admin-only management.
3) This must be a UI display-only change for non-admin views.
4) Must work across desktop + mobile. No text truncation confusion.
5) Must not break search/filter. Search should still work against the full set name in the DB.

REQUIREMENTS
A) USER-FACING DISPLAY (NON-ADMIN)
- On any non-admin user-facing screens that show subsets under a main set (like the screenshot grid):
  - Display label should be a "Short Subset Name":
    - If card_sets.name contains " - " AND begins with the main set name, show only the portion after the FIRST " - ".
      Example:
        main set: "2025 Topps Marvel Comic Book Heroes 1975 Golden Anniversary"
        subset: "2025 Topps Marvel Comic Book Heroes 1975 Golden Anniversary - Black & Gold"
        display => "Black & Gold"
    - If card_sets.name exactly equals the main set name (no subset delimiter), display => "Base Set"
    - If card_sets.name does NOT include " - " or does not match the expected prefix, do NOT attempt risky parsing:
        display => card_sets.name (fallback)
- Also display a small "Year" or keep the year line as-is, but the primary title should be short.
- The cards count line stays as-is (ex: "4 cards").

B) ADMIN DISPLAY
- In Admin mode (Admin toggle on OR on /admin routes), continue to display the FULL name exactly as stored.
- Admin views include:
  - Migration Console lists
  - Admin set editors
  - Any admin tools pages where identifying the full canonical string matters
No shortening in admin.

C) WHERE TO APPLY
Search for any components rendering card_set tiles/cards sets lists, especially:
- browse -> main set details page where subsets are shown (grid)
- any marketplace browse sets UI (if it reuses same component)
- set-thumbnail / set tile components
- any “Card Sets” section pages

Implement the short name logic in ONE shared utility to avoid inconsistencies:
- Create `client/src/lib/setDisplayName.ts` (or similar)
- Export function:
  `getCardSetDisplayName({ cardSetName, mainSetName, isAdmin }): string`
- Use it wherever subset tiles are rendered in non-admin contexts.

D) HOW TO DETECT ADMIN
We already have Admin Mode toggle in the UI.
- Use the existing “admin mode” state/hook/store the app uses (do NOT invent a new one).
- Also treat any route under `/admin/*` as admin context even if toggle is off.
So `isAdmin = adminToggleEnabled || pathname startsWith '/admin'`.

E) UI POLISH
- Increase readability on mobile:
  - the subset title should wrap to max 2 lines (clamp) and not overflow
  - if it’s “Base Set” show a small pill/badge “Base”
- Ensure the edit icon / admin buttons remain unchanged.

F) QA / REGRESSION CHECKLIST (MUST DO)
1) Non-admin user:
   - Browse -> open a main set -> view subset grid
   - Confirm subset titles show ONLY subset portion or “Base Set”
   - Confirm navigation still works
2) Admin mode ON:
   - Same page should show FULL names (main + subset)
3) Migration console:
   - Source + destination lists still show full names, and search still finds full names
4) Search:
   - Searching for “Golden Anniversary” still finds the subset sets even if the display label is “Black & Gold”
5) Edge cases:
   - A set name with multiple “ - ” only splits on the first delimiter after the prefix match
   - A set name that doesn’t start with main set name falls back safely
6) No database writes performed for this feature.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement the shared helper + update the relevant components
- Keep the change minimal and safe for production
- Report which files changed and what manual QA you performed.
