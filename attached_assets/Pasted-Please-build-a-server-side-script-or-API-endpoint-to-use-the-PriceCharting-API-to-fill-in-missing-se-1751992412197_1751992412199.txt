Please build a server-side script or API endpoint to use the PriceCharting API to fill in missing sets and cards in the Marvel Card Vault database.

🔷 Workflow Overview:
Query the PriceCharting API for all trading card sets in the “Marvel” category/platform.

For each set in the API response:

Check if this set already exists in the card_sets table by name.

If it does not exist:

Insert it into the DB with the relevant fields.

If it does exist:

Query all cards already in that set from the DB.

For each card returned from PriceCharting:

If that card (by card name + card number) does not exist in the DB:

Insert it under the correct set.

If it already exists:

Skip and log it.

🔷 Requirements:
Use the PRICECHARTING_API_TOKEN secret (already stored in Replit) to authenticate — pass it as the t query parameter.

Log all inserted records to the console.

Log all skipped (already-existing) records to a CSV or JSON file for QA purposes.

Support a limit parameter for testing (default: 50 cards per run).

Include error handling for API failures and DB errors.

Ensure the script is idempotent — running it twice in a row should not create duplicates.

Respect any documented PriceCharting API rate limits (throttle if needed).

Build it as a one-off job that can be run manually from the server root (e.g. npm run import-pricecharting).

🔷 Notes:
Keep the matching logic conservative to avoid inserting incorrect records.

Do not insert records unless you are certain they belong to the correct set + card combination.

Assume the DB’s unique identifier for cards is at least (setId, cardNumber) or (setName, cardNumber), but please confirm that with me if unclear.

🔷 Ask First:
🚨 Before making assumptions about:

How to match PriceCharting sets/cards to our DB

What fields to include

How to handle pricing data or optional fields

…please ask clarifying questions in chat and wait for my answers.

Thank you — let me know what questions you have before starting so we don’t have to redo anything.
