You are updating the Marvel Card Vault app.
Do NOT refactor the whole app. Only add a visual “aura” system for cards on the Card Details screen.

High-Level Goal

On the card details page, every card should appear with a subtle glow/aura behind it that reflects its value/rarity.

This is a visual design enhancement, not a major feature.

It should make high-value cards feel more special without looking cheesy or distracting.

The aura appears ONLY on the Card Details screen, not in binders, lists, or grids.

1. Where to Implement

Find the component that renders the Card Details view (where a single card is shown prominently).

Often named something like CardDetails, CardDetailPage, CardView, etc.

Identify the main card preview/image container (the element that visually shows the card).

We will wrap this element in a new CardAura wrapper or apply aura classes around it.

2. Data Inputs & Tier Logic

We want the aura to be determined primarily by price, with support for manual override.

Assume each card object has:

estimatedValue (number, in USD) – if named differently, use the existing price field.

Optionally: auraTierOverride or displayTier (string) – if present, it should override price-based tiers.

A. Aura Tiers

Implement 4 tiers:

common – low value

uncommon – mid value

rare – high value

grail – top tier

B. Default Price-Based Mapping

Create a small utility or config that maps price to tier, e.g.:

estimatedValue < 5 → "common"

5 <= estimatedValue < 25 → "uncommon"

25 <= estimatedValue < 100 → "rare"

estimatedValue >= 100 → "grail"

Put these thresholds in a single config object so they can be tuned later.

C. Manual Override

If the card object has a auraTierOverride (or similar) field with values "common" | "uncommon" | "rare" | "grail", then use that instead of price.

Pseudo-logic:

const tier = card.auraTierOverride ?? getAuraTierFromPrice(card.estimatedValue);

3. UI Implementation – Card Aura

Create a reusable component or styling pattern, e.g. CardAura:

<CardAura tier={tier}>
  {/* existing card image / preview */}
</CardAura>


or use a wrapper div with tier-based classes.

A. Visual Style (Base)

The card itself must remain sharp and untouched.

The aura lives behind the card:

Use a wrapper div with position: relative;

The aura is a ::before pseudo-element or inner div with position: absolute; z-index: -1.

B. Common Styles Across All Tiers

Soft, blurred radial gradient behind the card.

Slight drop shadow for depth.

Rounded shape that follows the card outline (can be a circle/oval slightly larger than the card).

Subtle slow shimmer animation (Option 2B):

Very low opacity pulsing or gentle expansion/contract of the glow.

Keep animation performance-friendly (use opacity/transform, not expensive box-shadows).

C. Tier-Specific Styles

Create CSS classes like:

.aura-common

.aura-uncommon

.aura-rare

.aura-grail

And define them roughly as:

Common

Very soft, low-opacity glow

Neutral grey/soft white gradient

Almost imperceptible, just enough to keep consistency that every card has an aura.

Uncommon

Slightly stronger glow

Cool-toned (blue/teal) radial gradient

Rare

Noticeably brighter glow

Purple/magenta or red-violet gradient

Slightly more spread and intensity

Grail

Strongest glow (but still tasteful)

Warm gold/orange/red gradient similar to the reference image you showed

Larger radius, maybe layered gradients

Slightly stronger shimmer / pulse (still slow and subtle)

No particles or crazy FX yet — keep it clean and performant.

4. Animation Details

Use a single keyframes definition, e.g. @keyframes auraPulse:

Animate opacity and/or transform: scale() between two close values (like 0.9 ↔ 1, 0.4 ↔ 0.6 opacity).

Apply the animation to the aura element for all tiers, but:

Commons: very low intensity (low opacity, shorter radius)

Grails: slightly stronger (still not distracting)

Example:

.aura-common::before {
  animation: auraPulse 6s ease-in-out infinite;
}

.aura-grail::before {
  animation: auraPulse 4s ease-in-out infinite;
}


Keep animation durations long (4–8 seconds) so it feels like a soft breathing glow rather than a flashing effect.

5. No Changes Outside Card Details

Do not show auras in:

Binder view

Browse view

Search results

Collection grids

The aura is only for the main Card Details screen.

Do not implement binder-page glow interactions yet — just leave a small TODO comment in the code, e.g.:

// TODO: In the future, consider a quick glow pulse when a card is added,
// triggered from the binder flow. For now, aura effects live only on CardDetails.

6. QA Checks

Before finishing, verify:

Every Card Details screen shows some aura (even low-value cards).

Price-based tier mapping works correctly across sample cards of different values.

Manual auraTierOverride (if present) wins over the price logic.

Animations are smooth and not visually overwhelming on:

Desktop

Mobile

No layout shift or overlap: the aura should never obscure the card art or text.

No console errors or TypeScript issues.

At the end, summarize:

Components updated (e.g. CardDetails.tsx, CardAura.tsx)

New CSS/SCSS modules or classes created

Where the tier thresholds are defined so they can be tweaked later.
