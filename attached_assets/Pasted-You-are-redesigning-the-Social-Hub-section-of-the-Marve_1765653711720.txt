You are redesigning the Social Hub section of the Marvel Card Vault app.
Do NOT rewrite the entire page. Only restyle and restructure the UI to create a cleaner, modern, social-friendly layout.

Goals:

Replace the harsh, boxy, multicolor design with a sleek, minimal, cohesive UI.

Make the Social Hub feel like a modern chat/community interface (Discord/Instagram influence).

Improve readability, reduce visual clutter, and create a unified aesthetic.

1. Tabs Redesign

Replace the existing large red-bordered tabs with a segmented control:

Container: rounded pill, subtle grey background

Selected tab: white background, bold text, slight shadow

Non-selected tabs: medium grey text

Add subtle icons (Friends, Messages, Powers)

2. Friend List Cards

Redesign each friend row into a compact social tile:

Avatar: circular, initials fallback

Username + @handle stacked

Status dot (green/grey) next to username or under handle

Action buttons (Message, View Profile) should be small icon-buttons or pill-style micro-buttons

Card background: white with soft shadow and rounded corners

Remove all thick borders

Spacing should be tighter but balanced.

3. Messages Panel (Basic Improvement)

If messages exist:

Show list of conversations on the left in a slim column

When a conversation is selected, show chat panel on the right

Keep this lightweight — do not build a full chat app yet

Use simple card styling consistent with the friend tiles

4. Pending Invitations Card

Redesign the large yellow panel:

Replace with small white or light grey card

Soft rounded corners and shadow

Use an icon (inbox or clock)

Text: smaller, friendlier microcopy

Add CTA: “Invite Friends” button (default style)

5. Color & Style Harmonization

Apply consistent design tokens:

Red: primary accent (used minimally)

Black/dark grey: text

Light grey backgrounds for sections

White cards with elevation for content

Remove:

Hard borders

Bright yellow backgrounds

Overly large buttons

Mismatched shapes

6. Responsiveness

Ensure:

Friend tiles stack vertically

Message list collapses into icon-only list or modal on mobile

Tabs remain scrollable on small screens

7. Deliverables

At completion, summarize:

Files/components modified

New components created (if any)
