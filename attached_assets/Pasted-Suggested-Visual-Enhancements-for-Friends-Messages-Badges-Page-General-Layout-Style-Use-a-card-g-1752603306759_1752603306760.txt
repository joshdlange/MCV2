Suggested Visual Enhancements for Friends/Messages/Badges Page
✅ General Layout & Style
Use a card grid layout instead of two equally plain boxes.

Friend cards (with avatars, names, and “message” or “remove” buttons).

Request cards (with avatars, names, and “accept/decline” buttons).

Reduce the heavy black tab bar — replace with comic-style tabs (e.g. speech-bubble shaped or lighter border with bold comic font).

Add more visual hierarchy (larger title, smaller “(0)” counters in a badge style).

🔗 Friends Section
Show a placeholder avatar/icon for each friend or request with “No friends yet” styled like a character panel.

When friends exist:

Display as cards with avatars, usernames, and badges.

Use color-coded badges or symbols to denote online/offline status.

✉️ Messages Tab
Add an unread message badge count on the tab itself.

Display conversation preview cards on the Messages page:

Avatar + Name + Last Message Snippet + Timestamp

Subtle hover highlight and “New” badge for unread.

🏅 Badges Tab
Display earned badges as colorful icons with tooltips or click-to-expand descriptions.

Show “Locked” badges as greyed-out with a comic-style lock symbol.

Use Marvel-inspired colors (red, gold, blue, black) and slight gradients for flare.

🎨 Thematic Suggestions
Replace plain fonts with a comic-inspired headline font for titles and tabs.

Add light comic-book-style “panel” borders around each section.

Use subtle background textures (e.g., faint dots or halftones) to avoid flat grey.

📝 Prompt to Replit
Improve the visual design and layout of the Friends/Messages/Badges section to make it fit the Marvel comic book theme. Specific changes:

Make the tabs styled like comic-book speech bubbles with bold, fun font.

Use a card grid for friends and requests, showing avatars, usernames, and buttons (e.g., message, remove, accept, decline).

Add placeholder avatars and better styling for the “No friends yet” and “No pending requests” states.

On the Badges tab, display earned badges with colorful icons and descriptions, and locked badges as greyed-out with a lock icon.

Messages tab: show a preview card for each conversation (avatar, name, last message snippet, timestamp) and badge counts for unread messages.

Use a more vibrant Marvel-inspired color palette, subtle textures, and comic-book-style borders/panels.

Keep the functionality the same — these are purely visual and stylistic improvements.
