We are adding a "Share My Binder" feature to Marvel Card Vault.

This is a marketing feature. It must be lightweight, performant, secure, and branded properly. It must NOT slow down the app or create heavy storage load.

Read this carefully and implement exactly as described.

=====================================================
FEATURE: SHARE MY SUBSET BINDER (PHASE 1)
=====================================================

GOAL:
Allow a user to generate a shareable link to a specific SUBSET binder page (not main set yet). This page will show the full checklist of that subset with owned cards highlighted.

This is a marketing tool. The shared page must:

• Be branded as Marvel Card Vault
• Show our logo prominently
• Include a clear CTA to create an account
• Be optimized for social sharing
• Not expose sensitive user data
• Be dynamically updated if the user adds more cards later

=====================================================
SCOPE (PHASE 1 ONLY)
=====================================================

✔ Share Scope: SUBSET ONLY
✔ Privacy Default: Anyone with link (not publicly indexed)
✔ Show: Full checklist with owned cards highlighted
✔ Do NOT show prices or market values
✔ Share link must be revocable
✔ Link must be dynamic (not static snapshot)

We will add entire collection later. Do not build that yet.

=====================================================
HOW IT SHOULD WORK
=====================================================

1) USER ACTION

Inside a subset binder page, add a button:

[ Share This Binder ]

When clicked:
• Generate a secure share token
• Store it in DB
• Return a URL like:

https://marvelcardvault.com/share/{token}

=====================================================
DATABASE REQUIREMENTS
=====================================================

Create new table:

shared_binders
- id (uuid or secure random token)
- user_id
- subset_id
- is_active (boolean, default true)
- created_at
- revoked_at (nullable)

Rules:
• Token must be long + unguessable (crypto random)
• Revoking sets is_active = false
• Do NOT store card snapshot data
• Shared page should dynamically read current collection

=====================================================
SHARED PAGE BEHAVIOR
=====================================================

Route: /share/:token

Server must:
• Validate token
• Confirm is_active = true
• Fetch subset
• Fetch full checklist for subset
• Fetch user’s owned cards for that subset

Render:

-----------------------------------------------------
[ Marvel Card Vault Logo ]

{User Name}'s Binder
{Subset Name}
{Main Set Name}
-----------------------------------------------------

Display grid of ALL cards in subset.

Owned cards:
• Full color
• Possibly checkmark badge

Missing cards:
• Slightly faded / grayscale

Do NOT show:
• Prices
• Market data
• Trade
• Edit controls
• Admin controls

-----------------------------------------------------
FOOTER CTA SECTION
-----------------------------------------------------

Add marketing section at bottom:

"Track your own Marvel card collection for free."

[ Create Your Free Account ]

This button links to signup page.

Include subtle affiliate exposure:
"Looking to buy? View cards on eBay directly from Marvel Card Vault."

=====================================================
PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
=====================================================

CRITICAL:
This must not slow the system.

• No snapshot storage
• No heavy queries
• Use indexed lookups
• Only fetch subset-specific data
• No N+1 queries
• No caching required initially

Do not preload other sets.
Do not include trending.
Do not include stats queries.

=====================================================
SOCIAL SHARE BUTTONS
=====================================================

On the shared page include lightweight share buttons:

• Facebook
• X (Twitter)
• Reddit
• Instagram (copy link instruction)

These should just share the page URL.

No heavy SDKs.
No tracking scripts.
Keep lightweight.

=====================================================
REVOCATION
=====================================================

Inside user settings or subset page:

Add:
[ Manage Shared Links ]

Allow:
• View active links
• Revoke link

If revoked:
Shared page must return 404.

=====================================================
SECURITY RULES
=====================================================

• No email exposure
• No user ID exposure
• No collection counts outside subset
• Token must be validated server-side
• Rate limit access if necessary

=====================================================
BRANDING
=====================================================

This is critical.

Shared page must:
• Use Marvel Card Vault colors
• Include logo at top
• Use Bangers font for headings
• Look polished and intentional
• Feel like a landing page

This is marketing.

=====================================================
DO NOT
=====================================================

• Do NOT build main set sharing yet
• Do NOT build full collection sharing yet
• Do NOT store static HTML snapshots
• Do NOT slow existing browse pages
• Do NOT break production routes

=====================================================
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
=====================================================

1) Add DB table
2) Add secure token generator
3) Add API endpoint to create share link
4) Add API endpoint to revoke link
5) Add public share route
6) Add share button to subset page
7) Add branding and CTA
8) QA performance impact

=====================================================
DELIVERABLE
=====================================================

Return:
• Files changed
• DB migration SQL
• Route definitions
• How to test
• Confirmation no existing routes impacted

This must be production safe.
