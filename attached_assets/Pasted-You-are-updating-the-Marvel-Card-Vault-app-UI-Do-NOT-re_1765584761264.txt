You are updating the Marvel Card Vault app UI.
Do NOT refactor the entire project. Only update the Dashboard stats/header section that shows:

Total Cards

Insert Cards

Total Value

Wishlist Items

Overall Goals

Make the stats area more compact and use less vertical space.

Make the section feel sleek, modern, and Marvel-inspired.

Redesign the icons so they look premium (no more “clip-art” feel).

Improve the new user onboarding by nudging users to add their first cards.

1. Layout Changes

Replace the current four large white cards with:

Row 1 – Compact Stats Bar

A single horizontal card that contains 4 stat “pills” or compact tiles, one for each metric.

Each stat pill should include:

A circular icon badge on the left

A small label (e.g., “TOTAL CARDS”)

A bold number underneath

Layout guidelines:

On desktop: all 4 pills in one row.

On mobile: wrap into 2×2 grid or horizontal scroll, whichever is cleaner.

Reduce overall height compared to the current design.

Row 2 – Onboarding / Next Steps Card

Directly under the stats bar, add a single onboarding card that changes based on collection size:

If totalCards === 0:

Title: “Let’s build your first Marvel vault.”

Subtext: “Add a few cards to unlock stats, total value, and set progress.”

Primary button: “Add Your First Cards” → hook into existing add-cards flow.

Secondary link: “Explore sets first”

If totalCards > 0:

Title: “Nice start! Keep building your collection.”

Subtext example:
“You’ve added {totalCards} cards so far. Add 10 more to see richer value insights.”

Primary button: “Add More Cards”

Secondary link: “View All Sets”

On desktop, this card can have text on the left and a subtle graphic/gradient on the right; on mobile, stack vertically.

2. Icon Redesign (Important)

The current icons feel flat and “clip-arty.”
Redesign them to look clean, custom, and Marvel-adjacent, without overdoing it.

You may use an icon set like lucide-react (if already used elsewhere) or create simple custom SVGs.

New icon guidelines:

Each stat gets a circular badge behind the icon:

Slight gradient or soft glow

Drop shadow or inner shadow to give depth

Background circle colors (suggestion):

Total Cards: red / dark red gradient

Insert Cards: gold / yellow gradient

Total Value: green gradient

Wishlist: pink / magenta gradient

Icons themselves should be:

Simple, bold shapes (e.g. stack, star, dollar, heart)

Single-color or two-tone that contrasts with the circle

Scaled to feel balanced (not tiny, not cartoonishly large)

The stat pill design:

Slightly rounded rectangle or pill with subtle border or shadow

Neutral background (off-white or dark gray depending on the current theme)

Typography consistent with the app (same font families & sizes).

The goal is to make the icons pop while still looking clean and modern — think “Marvel UI card dashboard,” not generic clip art.

3. Styling & Branding

Keep consistent with Marvel Card Vault branding:

Main accents: red, black, white, with small pops of gold/green/pink.

Make sure the new section works with the existing dark/light background of the dashboard.

Use consistent spacing/margins with the rest of the app.

4. Implementation Details

Locate the component that renders these stats on the dashboard (e.g. DashboardStats, OverviewCards, etc.).

Refactor into:

StatsBar (compact icons + numbers)

OnboardingCard (conditional content based on totalCards)

Reuse existing data (totalCards, insertCards, totalValue, wishlistItems) — do NOT change backend or API shapes.

If you introduce a new icon library (like lucide-react), add the dependency, but only if it’s not already present and keep usage minimal.

5. QA Checklist

Before finishing:

Check desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

Confirm the new section occupies less vertical space than the old 4-card row.

Verify large numbers (e.g., 1,600 cards, $50,000 value) still look good and don’t overflow.

Verify buttons and links still trigger the correct existing flows.

Ensure there are no console errors or TypeScript issues.

Do not modify unrelated components or routes.
