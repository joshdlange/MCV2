MISSION: Fix unreadable buttons + fix binder desktop layout so 3×3 binder page never requires scroll.

Ground Rules (critical)

Do NOT do broad UI redesign. Fix only what is required.

No “best effort” guessing. Use a single source of truth for button styles.

Remove hover effects globally where they are causing readability issues.

After changes, every button must pass a basic contrast sanity check (readable at a glance).

Binder must fit 3×3 cards fully inside the viewport (no vertical scrolling), while preserving card aspect ratio.

1) Fix unreadable buttons everywhere (white-on-white, black-on-black)
Problem

Many buttons became unreadable (example: Admin Tools input/button area in left sidebar). There are also lingering hover effects even after attempted removal.

Requirements
A. Create one global button system

Identify the button component(s) used throughout the app.

If there is a shared Button component (e.g. client/src/components/ui/button.tsx), that becomes canonical.

If multiple button implementations exist, consolidate so the whole app uses one.

All buttons must have predictable variants:

primary (Marvel red background, white text)

secondary (dark background, white text)

outline (transparent bg, border, readable text)

ghost (minimal, readable on dark + light)

danger (red but darker/stronger than hover states)

B. Enforce readable default states (no more invisible buttons)

Define CSS variables (or theme tokens) for:

button background

button text color

button border color

Ensure every variant has explicit text color and background color.

No variant may inherit text color from parent containers.

C. Kill hover effects (the correct way)

We need to remove hover styles that break readability. Do not just “remove some hover classes” in random places.

Implement one of these approaches:

(Preferred) In the Button component: remove hover styles by default for ALL variants.

Or: add a global CSS rule that neutralizes hover styling app-wide for buttons/links if they use common classes.

Specifically remove:

background color changes on hover that reduce contrast

text color changes on hover that reduce contrast

opacity hover that makes text faint

If you keep hover at all, it must ONLY be:

a subtle brightness change that does not change text color

or a small shadow
But my preference: no hover styling at all for now.

D. Fix form/button in Admin sidebar

In the left sidebar screenshot, the “Admin Tools” field/button area is unreadable.

Locate the exact component rendering that Admin UI section.

Ensure background, border, and text color are set explicitly.

Ensure disabled states are readable (disabled should look disabled, but still visible).

E. Deliverables for button work

List the canonical button file path(s) used

List every file changed

Provide “before/after” screenshots or a short description of what was fixed

Confirm hover styles are removed and show the exact CSS/component changes where hover was removed

2) Binder page fix: 3×3 grid must fit without scrolling on desktop
Problem

Binder view looks great on mobile/tablet, but on desktop the card grid overflows vertically and forces scrolling.

Requirements
A. Binder grid must always fit in the viewport

On any screen size, the binder content area must be sized so that:

the 3×3 grid of cards is fully visible without vertical scrolling

cards preserve aspect ratio

cards scale down on desktop so the full grid fits

B. Layout approach (must implement this exact concept)

The binder page should have a container with height:

calc(100vh - headerHeight - any top toolbars - padding)

Inside that container:

Use CSS Grid for a 3×3 layout (desktop)

Cards should use aspect-ratio matching your card images (e.g., 2.5/3.5-ish). If you already know the ratio, use it consistently.

Each card tile should scale based on available container height.

C. No internal scroll

The binder grid container must have overflow: hidden (or no overflow) so the page itself doesn’t scroll.

Any scroll gestures on desktop should not be needed to view the 9 cards on a page.

D. Maintain existing “carousel/paging” behavior

In the screenshot, binder has paging (e.g., “2 of 12”).

Keep that paging behavior.

But ensure each page shows 9 cards in view without scroll.

E. Specific sizing strategy (use one of these)

Option 1 (preferred): grid + auto-resize using container height

Determine container height

Compute max card height as:

(containerHeight - verticalGaps - padding) / 3

Compute card width from aspect ratio.

Apply to each tile.

Option 2: pure CSS using aspect-ratio + max-height

Container: fixed height (calc 100vh - chrome)

Grid rows: repeat(3, 1fr) with minmax(0, 1fr)

Each tile uses aspect-ratio and height: 100%

Ensure the image inside uses object-fit: contain or cover depending on desired look, but it must not overflow.

F. Deliverables for binder work

Identify the binder component file (likely something like binder-view.tsx or similar)

Provide exactly what CSS/layout changes were made

Confirm with a desktop viewport test (e.g., 1440×900 and 1920×1080) that:

page shows all 9 cards without scrolling

cards keep aspect ratio and don’t look stretched

Testing Checklist (must complete)

Desktop: verify Admin sidebar “Admin Tools” UI is readable.

Desktop: verify primary/secondary/outline buttons readable on:

sidebar

marketplace

modals

forms

Verify hover does not change button colors anywhere.

Binder page:

Desktop: no scroll needed to see the 3×3 grid

Mobile: existing good behavior remains unchanged

Implementation Rules

Make changes incremental and test after each section.

Do not refactor unrelated components.

Do not alter business logic.

Keep PR-style change summary with file list and reasoning.
