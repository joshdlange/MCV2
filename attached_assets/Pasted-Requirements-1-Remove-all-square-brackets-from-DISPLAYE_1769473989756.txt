Requirements
1) Remove all square brackets from DISPLAYED names

Any card name or set name containing [ or ] should have those characters removed in the UI only.

Examples:

Iron Man [Blue] #1 → Iron Man Blue #1

Thena [SuperFractor] #2 → Thena SuperFractor #2

marvel 2024 upper deck spider man renditions impel
→ Marvel 2024 Upper Deck Spider Man Renditions Impel

⚠️ Do not mutate database values unless explicitly instructed later.
This should be handled via a shared formatter.

2) Capitalization rules (must be consistent everywhere)

Create or update a single shared formatter utility (likely formatTitle.ts) and use it consistently.

Capitalization rules:

First letter must always be capitalized

Title-case words (except small words like “of”, “and”, “the”, unless at start)

Preserve numbers and symbols

Preserve known acronyms if already uppercase (XMEN, SPIDER-MAN, etc.)

Normalize excessive spacing

Examples:

marvel card vault → Marvel Card Vault

2024 marvel masterpieces featuring nauel grego
→ 2024 Marvel Masterpieces Featuring Nauel Grego

3) Where this MUST be applied

Apply the formatter to all display points, including but not limited to:

Set list

Set detail header

Card grid tiles

Card detail modal

Binder view

Marketplace listing titles

Wishlist

Any “Back to Sets” / breadcrumb headers

Do not rely on “some components already do it.”
Ensure all user-visible titles pass through the formatter.

4) Implementation constraints (important)

Use one formatter function

No regex scattered across components

No DB migrations

No backend changes

No renaming of image files or URLs

5) Deliverables (required)

When finished, report:

Formatter function code

Files where it was applied

Confirmation that no DB writes occur

3 example before/after strings from the app

Safety Rule

If a title is already clean and capitalized, do not change it.

Why this matters

Inconsistent casing and leftover bracket syntax makes the app feel unpolished and hurts trust. This fix must be deterministic, reversible, and low-risk.
