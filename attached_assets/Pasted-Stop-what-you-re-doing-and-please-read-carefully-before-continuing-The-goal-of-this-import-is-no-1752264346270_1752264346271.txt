Stop what you’re doing and please read carefully before continuing.

✅ The goal of this import is not to pull generic “Marvel” products.
✅ The goal is to:

Take each existing set name in our database.

Query PriceCharting specifically for products matching that set name.

For each matching product, parse out card number and card name.

Insert only cards that do not already exist in that set.

📋 Correct Approach:
For each card set in our database:
1️⃣ Take its setName.
2️⃣ Query PriceCharting API for products:

bash
Copy
Edit
/api/products?platform=trading-card&q=${encodeURIComponent(setName)}&t=${API_KEY}
✅ This ensures we only get products relevant to that specific set.
3️⃣ For each product returned:

Parse the name field to extract:

setName

cardNumber

cardName

Check if a card with that setId + cardNumber already exists.

If it does not exist, insert it.

📄 Example Code Snippet for API Call:
ts
Copy
Edit
const response = await fetch(
  `https://www.pricecharting.com/api/products?platform=trading-card&q=${encodeURIComponent(set.name)}&t=${API_KEY}`
);
const data = await response.json();
const products = data.products || [];
Then iterate products, parse and insert missing cards.

🧹 Additionally:
✅ Remove any fuzzy matching against unrelated products.
✅ Do not match to video games or toys — the only products we care about are Marvel trading cards for that set name.
✅ Do not assume “Marvel” alone is enough — always use the full set name as the query.

✅ Fix This Now:
Update the script to query per set using the correct endpoint and q=${setName}.

Remove any fallback code that queries q=marvel globally.

Remove any fuzzy matches to unrelated products.

Run against just 1–2 sets and confirm it actually adds missing cards.

Notes:
🚫 Do not claim “no cards were added because they already existed” when you’re querying the wrong data.
🚫 Do not fetch generic Marvel merchandise.
✅ This is a per-set import that fills gaps based on specific set names.

Please acknowledge each step is done before moving forward and show the exact API call being made in logs so I can verify it’s querying correctly.

Thank you.
