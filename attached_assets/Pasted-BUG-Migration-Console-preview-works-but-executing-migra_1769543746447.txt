BUG: Migration Console preview works, but executing migration fails with:
500: {"message":"Failed to execute migration"}

This is blocking all progress. Fix this FIRST with minimal changes, admin-only, and do not touch public app.

STEP 1 — Make the error actionable (server)
In the migrate execute route (server/routes.ts), update the catch block so it returns:
- HTTP 500 with:
  - error.message
  - error.stack (or at least error.name + message)
  - sourceSetId, destinationSetId, cardCount being migrated
Also log the full error to server console.

Right now we only return “Failed to execute migration” which hides the real cause.

STEP 2 — Reproduce with the exact example
Use the currently selected case:
- Source: “2025 Kakawow Aura Angel” (83 cards) set_id = 2243
- Destination: “2025 Kakawow Aura Marvel - Angel” set_id = 6277 (canonical)
Attempt migration and capture the *real* error.

STEP 3 — Fix the actual cause (common culprits to check in order)
A) Transaction / Drizzle schema mismatch
- Confirm cards.setId column name matches schema (set_id vs setId) and update query accordingly.
- Confirm destinationSetId exists in card_sets.
- Confirm sourceSetId exists.
- Confirm the update query uses correct eq() field.

B) Foreign key constraints
- Ensure cards.set_id FK → card_sets.id isn’t violated (destination must exist, it does).
- If a migration_log_cards insert references missing migration_log_id, fix insertion order (create log row first, then log_cards).

C) Logging insert failing
- If migration_log_cards insertion is failing due to nulls or wrong field names, fix mapping.
- Insert one row per card OR bulk insert, but ensure columns match DB.

D) Conflict phrase enforcement mismatch
- If server expects a phrase but client isn’t sending it, return 400 with a clear message (not 500).

STEP 4 — Add “dry-run execute” safety
Before updating cards, run:
- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE set_id=source
- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card_sets WHERE id=destination
If counts don’t match expected, return 400 with explanation.

STEP 5 — QA (must do)
- Re-run the Kakawow 83 card migration and confirm it succeeds.
- Verify at least 3 migrated cards:
  - set_id changed to destination
  - image URLs preserved
  - estimated_value preserved
- Confirm user collections remain intact (card_id unchanged).
- Confirm migration_logs entry created and rollback works.

DELIVERABLES
- The actual underlying error message you found (paste it)
- Files changed
- Confirmation migration + rollback both work
