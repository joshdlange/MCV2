🚫 Explicit DO NOTs
❌ Do not use PriceCharting or any other API

❌ Do not store or fetch card images locally — only use the eBay-provided image URLs

❌ No fuzzy keyword experiments — stick to "Marvel trading cards" search term and correct category filter

❌ No adding unrelated data points — only the ones listed above
