We need to fix and clean up the PriceCharting import implementation properly. Please follow these instructions carefully and do not make assumptions:

ðŸ§¹ Step 1 â€” Fix the API Call
âœ… In the current import code:

Make sure the script calls the correct PriceCharting API endpoint:

bash
Copy
Edit
/api/products?platform=trading-card&apikey=YOUR_KEY
This endpoint returns all trading card products, each representing an individual card.

Make sure the request includes our secret API key from process.env.PRICECHARTING_API_KEY.

Parse each productâ€™s name field using the agreed logic:

Example: "1992 Marvel Masterpieces #15 Spider-Man" â†’
setName: "1992 Marvel Masterpieces"
cardNumber: "15"
cardName: "Spider-Man"

Match the setName against our DB using a case-insensitive fuzzy match.

If no good match exists, log it for manual review but skip creating a new set.

Only insert cards that do not already exist (match on setId + cardNumber).

For inserted cards, store:

setId

cardName

cardNumber

frontImageUrl (from PriceCharting image_url)

price (from PriceCharting loose_price)

Add console logs and write progress to import.log.

ðŸ§¹ Step 2 â€” Clean Up Unnecessary Files
âœ… Delete only files or classes that are unrelated or broken from the earlier attempts:

PriceChartingImporter class file(s)

Any file named:

background-import.ts

backgroundPriceImport.ts

pricecharting-daemon.ts

Any server initialization code that auto-starts PriceCharting import on boot

Any progress-tracking JSON files like progress.json or complete-import.log (if left over)

Do NOT touch:

Any existing import/export tools unrelated to PriceCharting

Any production database files

Any unrelated API endpoints or routes

ðŸ§¹ Step 3 â€” Verify
âœ… After cleaning:

Confirm no auto-start logic remains in server/index.ts or server/routes.ts.

Confirm a single, manual, working import script remains (e.g., scripts/run-pricecharting-import.ts) which can be run with:

arduino
Copy
Edit
npx ts-node scripts/run-pricecharting-import.ts
Run a test against just 1 or 2 sets and confirm cards are being inserted.

ðŸ§¹ Important Notes:
ðŸš« Do not delete or rename unrelated files.
ðŸš« Do not create new background processes.
âœ… Keep it simple and transparent.
âœ… Output a log of what files you cleaned up and what you changed.

If you need me to re-state the card name parsing or set fuzzy-match logic, just ask before assuming anything. Please acknowledge each step is done before moving on.

Thanks.
