Bulk Image Updater Fails via Web, Works in Standalone
You're hitting a case where:

‚úÖ Standalone bulk image script works (~40% hit rate)

‚ùå Web-triggered /api/admin/update-missing-images fails immediately

‚úÖ Configs and credentials are present and valid

‚ùì Logs show no helpful error ‚Äî the process exits before any card logic is hit

üß∞ 1. Instrument the bulkUpdateMissingImages() Entry Point
In server/bulk-image-updater.ts, add logging at the top of bulkUpdateMissingImages() to confirm it‚Äôs actually being entered from the POST request.

ts
Copy
Edit
export async function bulkUpdateMissingImages({ limit, rateLimitMs }: { limit: number; rateLimitMs: number }) {
  console.log(`[DEBUG] Entered bulkUpdateMissingImages with limit=${limit}, rateLimitMs=${rateLimitMs}`);
  ...
}
‚û°Ô∏è If this log does not appear, the error is before the function is reached (likely auth or routing).

üîê 2. Verify requireAdmin Middleware Behavior
Since the route is protected with requireAdmin, verify:

req.user or req.uid is populated as expected

The isAdmin flag is reliably returned from your getUserFromFirebase() check

Add debug logs just before calling the actual handler:

ts
Copy
Edit
app.post('/api/admin/update-missing-images', requireAdmin, async (req, res) => {
  console.log(`[DEBUG] Authenticated user:`, req.user || req.uid);
  ...
});
‚û°Ô∏è If undefined, this may indicate Firebase JWT decoding is silently failing.

‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Check for Silent Async Failures
If bulkUpdateMissingImages() internally starts background tasks using await Promise.all() or other batch processing, make sure you aren't swallowing an error mid-loop without logging.

In your processCard() or inside the orchestration loop, add:

ts
Copy
Edit
try {
  // card logic
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`[ERROR] Failed to process card ${card.id}:`, err);
}
And more importantly:

ts
Copy
Edit
bulkUpdateMissingImages() {
  try {
    // ...
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`[FATAL] bulkUpdateMissingImages root failure:`, err);
    throw err;
  }
}
‚û°Ô∏è If you're using Array.map(async...) without await Promise.all, fix that ‚Äî the function may finish before the work is done.

üßµ 4. Are You Failing a DB Connection or Transaction Early?
Check the first DB query in bulkUpdateMissingImages(). If it's something like:

ts
Copy
Edit
const cards = await db.select().from(cardsTable).where(...);
and that query fails silently or returns zero, you'll short-circuit.

Add logging after fetching cards:

ts
Copy
Edit
console.log(`[DEBUG] Found ${cards.length} cards to process`);
If it‚Äôs 0, check whether the filter used in the web context differs from the standalone script (e.g., different isMissing, image IS NULL, or LIMIT logic).

üîÑ 5. Check for Payload/Destructuring Failures
In your POST endpoint:

ts
Copy
Edit
const { limit = 50, rateLimitMs = 1000 } = req.body;
‚û°Ô∏è Add:

ts
Copy
Edit
console.log(`[DEBUG] Bulk update request body:`, req.body);
Sometimes req.body isn‚Äôt parsed properly due to missing express.json() middleware or incorrect headers on the frontend call.

‚úÖ 6. Checklist of Common Express Failures:
Is express.json() used? If not, req.body may be undefined.

Are all async handlers wrapped in try/catch with explicit logging?

Does your admin Firebase check correctly verify the current user?

Are you using res.json() and not leaving Promises unhandled?

üß™ 7. Bonus Debug Tip
Wrap bulkUpdateMissingImages() in a timed block and track the full lifecycle:

ts
Copy
Edit
const start = Date.now();
console.log(`[DEBUG] Starting bulk image update...`);
await bulkUpdateMissingImages({ limit, rateLimitMs });
console.log(`[DEBUG] Completed in ${Date.now() - start}ms`);
If you never hit either line, the function isn't being reached at all.

üìå Conclusion:
Based on symptoms, this is very likely a failure before reaching the core logic ‚Äî either in:

Middleware (requireAdmin)

Request body parsing (req.body)

A DB read throwing silently

Or async code failing without logs

Once the logs confirm entry into bulkUpdateMissingImages(), we can tighten error recovery or retry logic inside the loop.
