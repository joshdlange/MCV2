DO NOT pull all trading card products blindly
Please do not blindly pull all products with platform=trading-card and process them all.
We are only interested in cards that belong to sets we already have in our database (or closely match).

✅ First, query our database for all card_sets.name (and their id)
✅ Then, for each product you get from PriceCharting:

Parse its product.name and decide if it belongs to one of our existing sets.

If it does → check for missing cards and insert accordingly.

If it does not match any existing set → skip it entirely (or optionally log for manual review).

We do NOT want unrelated Pokémon, Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, Star Wars, etc. cards — only Marvel sets that map to our DB.

🔍 Answers to Specific Questions:
1️⃣ Product name parsing rules:
✅ Assume most names follow patterns like:

"1992 Marvel Masterpieces #15 Spider-Man"
→ setName = "1992 Marvel Masterpieces", cardNumber = "15", cardName = "Spider-Man"

"X-Men Series 1 Wolverine #45"
→ setName = "X-Men Series 1", cardNumber = "45", cardName = "Wolverine"

Rules:

Look for #NN or NN near the end of the string (where NN is the card number).

The number is always associated with the card number.

Everything before the number is the setName.

Everything after the number is the cardName.

If no number is present but the name still matches an existing set:

Set cardNumber to "0" and use full name as cardName.

2️⃣ Set name matching threshold:
✅ Use fuzzy string matching.
✅ Examples of “close enough” matches:

"1992 Marvel Masterpieces" vs "1992 SkyBox Marvel Masterpieces" → YES, close.

"X-Men Series 1" vs "X-Men Series 1 SP" → YES, close.
✅ Examples of “different”:

"X-Men Series 1" vs "X-Men Series 2" → NO, different.

Rule of thumb:

If the name matches >= 85% similarity (ignoring minor words like “SkyBox,” “Base,” “SP”), consider it the same set.

Otherwise, skip or log for manual review.

3️⃣ Cards without cardNumber:
✅ If no card number can be parsed:

Set cardNumber to "0" and proceed.

Still insert it under the matched set.

4️⃣ Multiple mainSetId matches:
✅ If the parsed setName matches multiple existing card_sets:

Pick the one with the highest similarity.

If still ambiguous → log for manual review and skip inserting that card for now.

🧪 Next:
✅ Once you implement the above rules, run a dry-run first and log:

Number of PriceCharting products fetched.

How many mapped to existing sets.

How many cards were inserted.

✅ Do not insert any cards that don’t clearly belong to one of our sets.

Let me know if you have any questions before implementing.
