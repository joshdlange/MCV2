ou are updating the Marvel Card Vault web app.
Do NOT refactor the entire app. Only work on the “My Collection” → Set/Sub-set detail view where the user currently sees cards in a scroll/grid layout.

We want to introduce a new default “Binder View” plus an optional “Expanded Grid View”.

1. New Binder View (Default)

Replace the existing card grid in the set/subset detail screen with a Binder View that visually mimics a 9-pocket trading card binder page.

Core behavior:

Each “page” shows 9 card slots (3×3 grid), ordered by card number.

If the set has 100 cards and the user owns 1, 4, 6, 9, then:

Slots for 1, 4, 6, 9 show the user’s actual card image.

Slots for all other card numbers show a placeholder (see below).

There should be page navigation controls at the bottom or top:

Previous / Next

“Page X of Y”

Optional simple page index dots/numbers.

Visual style:

Use Option A from the discussion:
A classic Ultra Pro 9-pocket binder page, but clean and not tacky.

Background behind the 3×3 grid:

Subtle dark binder texture or flat dark panel

Rounded outer corners

Thin border or edge shadow to imply a “page”

Each pocket:

Slightly rounded rectangle

Subtle inner shadow / highlight to suggest plastic

Card image sits inside with a small margin, as if inside a sleeve

Placeholder for missing cards (E combination):

For slots where the user doesn’t own the card:

Show a greyscale placeholder with:

Card number (e.g. #24)

Card title if available (small text)

Subtle dashed border or lighter opacity to indicate “missing”

No “Find this card” button yet.

Important: Clicking a missing slot should behave exactly like clicking an owned card:
→ Navigate to the existing Card Details page using whatever route/ID the app already uses.

Later we will add marketplace / eBay logic on the details page, but not now.

2. Expanded Grid View (User Selectable)

Add a view toggle above the binder:

Default: Binder View (9 per page)

Option: Expanded Grid View

Behavior:

In Expanded Grid View, cards are shown in a responsive grid with more than 9 per page, automatically based on screen width.

This is a clean, modern card grid (no binder plastic texture), similar to what exists today but more polished.

Still show placeholders for missing cards, consistent with Binder View styling (same placeholders but without the binder page background).

Implementation idea:

Create a ViewModeToggle (e.g., tabs or segmented control):

“Binder” | “Grid”

Use the app’s existing styling / buttons.

3. Page Flip Animation (Binder View)

When the user changes pages in Binder View:

Use a 3D page curl / flip animation (Option D from discussion) or the closest feasible approximation using CSS/Framer Motion/React Spring—whatever is already used in the project, or simple CSS transforms if no animation library exists.

The effect should:

Animate old page out and new page in

Feel like turning a real binder page, but keep it performant

On mobile, make sure animation duration is short enough to feel snappy.

4. Add/Complete Animations

We want the binder to “celebrate” when cards are added.

When a card is added to the set:

In Binder View, if the card’s slot was previously empty on the current page:

The placeholder should animate into the real card:

e.g., quick glow + scale-up, or card slides into the pocket.

If the card is on a different page than the one currently visible:

Optionally show a subtle toast: “Card #24 added to page 3”.

When a page is fully completed (all 9 owned):

Brief celebration:

Soft glow over the entire page or individual pockets

Optional subtle confetti animation over the binder section (not full-screen).

When the entire set is completed:

Trigger a set completion celebration:

A badge or banner at the top of the set screen: “Set Completed!”

Optional confetti or animation overlay

Keep it short and non-intrusive.

No sound effects yet; visuals only.

5. Data & Routing

Use the existing data model for cards:

Total cards in the set

Which card numbers the user owns

Paths/IDs to each card’s detail view.

Do not change the backend API. Only change how the data is rendered.

Binder View must respect:

Card ordering (by card number)

Variants if the app has them (use existing logic; don’t invent new logic).

Click behavior for any slot (owned or missing):

Navigate to the existing Card Details screen for that card ID/number.

6. Component Structure (Suggested)

Create or update components along these lines:

SetDetailPage (existing)

Add state: viewMode = "binder" | "grid"

Render ViewModeToggle

Conditionally render BinderView or ExpandedGridView

BinderView

Accepts: cardsInSet, ownedCardsByNumber, etc.

Handles pagination (currentPage, totalPages)

Handles page flip animation and slot rendering.

ExpandedGridView

Similar to current grid but refined, using shared slot/card components.

BinderSlot

Renders either:

Owned card image

Missing placeholder with card number/title

Clickable → opens card details.

Keep props clear and reusable.

7. Styling & Responsiveness

Maintain Marvel Card Vault branding:

Dark/neutral background

Pops of red, white, and accent colors.

Binder View:

Should look great on desktop and tablet.

On small mobile screens, ensure:

3×3 grid is still legible

Tap targets meet accessibility sizes

Page navigation is accessible (bottom sticky controls are okay).

Expanded Grid View:

Use a standard responsive layout (e.g., minmax + auto-fit in CSS grid).

Ensure images are not distorted.

8. QA Checklist

Before finishing, verify:

Binder View is the default view when opening a set.

Toggle to Expanded Grid View and back works without layout glitches.

Page navigation works correctly and updates the correct 9 card slots.

Clicking an owned card and a missing card both open the correct Card Details view.

Animations perform smoothly on:

Desktop

A typical mobile breakpoint.

Large sets (100+ cards) behave correctly (page count, last partial page, etc.).

No console errors or TypeScript issues.

No existing routes or major components are broken by this change.
