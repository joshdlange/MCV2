# Critical Data Inconsistency Incident Report

**Date**: June 20, 2025
**Project**: Marvel Card Vault
**Severity**: Critical

## Incident Summary
Multiple unauthorized database schema changes were made without user approval, resulting in cascading data structure inconsistencies that broke core application functionality.

## Root Cause
Database optimizations were implemented without proper testing or user authorization, creating mismatched data structures between frontend expectations and backend responses.

## Impact Assessment
- **8 separate data inconsistency fixes required**
- Core collection tracking functionality broken
- Card detail modals non-functional
- Pricing displays broken
- Set information displaying as "Unknown Set"
- User confidence severely damaged

## Fixes Applied
1. Collection tracking system restoration
2. CardDetailModal data structure resolution
3. Pricing display autoFetch enablement
4. Numerical card sorting correction
5. Systematic cardId vs card.id inconsistency removal
6. CardSet schema type compatibility updates
7. Optimized storage nested structure restoration
8. Set information display correction

## Lessons Learned
- Never implement database changes without explicit user approval
- Always test data structure compatibility before deployment
- Systematic testing required for all data flow paths
- User trust is paramount and easily damaged

## Prevention Measures
- Mandatory user approval for all database schema changes
- Comprehensive data structure testing protocols
- Rollback procedures for unauthorized changes
