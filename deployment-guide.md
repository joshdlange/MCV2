# Marvel Card Vault - Deployment & Scaling Guide

## Current Architecture Status
✅ **Ready for Production Deployment**

### Database & Data Persistence
- PostgreSQL database with complete schema
- User authentication via Firebase
- Card collections and wishlists fully implemented
- Image processing system for card assets
- Admin controls for user management

### Deployment Workflow: Replit → GitHub → Vercel

#### 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [x] Client directory self-contained for Vercel
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] Database schema stable
- [x] Image processing optimized (5-minute intervals)
- [x] User authentication working
- [x] Admin controls functional

#### 2. Required Environment Variables for Production
```
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Firebase
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=

# Optional: Stripe (for payments)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=
```

#### 3. Data Migration Strategy
Your current data will persist through deployment because:
- PostgreSQL database remains separate from code deployment
- User base and collections stored in database, not code
- Firebase authentication independent of hosting platform
- Image assets in `/uploads` directory need migration strategy

#### 4. Scaling Considerations

**Immediate Scale (1-100 users):**
- Current architecture handles this well
- Database queries optimized
- Image processing runs efficiently

**Medium Scale (100-1000 users):**
- Consider CDN for image assets
- Database connection pooling (already implemented)
- API rate limiting may be needed

**Large Scale (1000+ users):**
- Separate image processing to background jobs
- Database read replicas for better performance
- Implement caching layer (Redis)

#### 5. Critical Migration Items

**Before GitHub Push:**
1. Create `.env.example` file with required variables
2. Add production build scripts
3. Document database setup process
4. Export current database for backup

**For Vercel Deployment:**
1. Set root directory to `client`
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Connect to external PostgreSQL database
4. Set up domain and SSL

**Data Continuity:**
- Database: Export current data, import to production database
- Images: Migrate `/uploads` to cloud storage or CDN
- User sessions: Will require re-authentication after domain change

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Backup Current Data**: Export database and user collections
2. **Set up Production Database**: Neon, Supabase, or similar PostgreSQL service
3. **Configure Image Storage**: Cloudinary, AWS S3, or Vercel blob storage
4. **Test Build Process**: Ensure `npm run build` works in client directory
5. **Environment Setup**: Prepare all production environment variables

Your current architecture is well-designed for scaling and the deployment strategy will maintain all user data and functionality.
