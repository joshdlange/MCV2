# Customer Compensation Plan

## Issue Summary
- Payment endpoints were accidentally removed from server
- 10+ customers attempted signups during outage (estimated dates: [INSERT DATES])
- Customers experienced payment failures during signup process

## Compensation Strategy

### 1. Stripe Discount Code Creation
**Steps to create in Stripe Dashboard:**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Products → Coupons
2. Create new coupon:
   - **Name**: "Payment Outage Compensation" 
   - **ID**: `OUTAGE_COMP_2MO`
   - **Type**: Duration discount
   - **Amount**: 100% off
   - **Duration**: 2 months
   - **Max redemptions**: 15 (buffer for affected users)

### 2. Affected Customer Identification
**Method 1: Server Logs**
- Check server error logs for failed `/api/create-checkout-session` requests
- Look for 404/500 errors during outage period

**Method 2: Firebase Analytics**
- Review signup attempts vs successful account upgrades
- Identify users who signed up but remain on free plan

### 3. Customer Outreach Plan
